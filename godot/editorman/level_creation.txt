[b]Creating your level[/b]

To add notes to your level, you'll use a variety of keybinds in Insert mode. Insert mode has a variety of keybinds made to quickly edit levels.

[b]Adding notes[/b]
To add notes, you press the keybinds [code]a[/code], [code]s[/code], [code]d[/code] to create notes. These will add notes in each of the key's respective lanes. If there is already a note where you press the keybind, you'll instead remove that note.

To add sustained notes, you press the keybinds [code]A[/code], [code]S[/code], [code]D[/code] to start a sustained note. If you press it again, you'll finish setting up the note and it will be added.

[b]Moving up and down[/b]
To move up and down in the chart, you press the keys [code]j[/code] and [code]k[/code]. This will move you one beat up and down by default, but you can change the scroll speed. The keybinds [code]J[/code] and [code]K[/code] will move you one quarter of the current scroll speed.

[code]<n>j[/code] and [code]<n>j[/code] will move you the supplied amount of beats up or down. Using their uppercase variants will move you the supplied amount of times the scroll speed.

To change the scroll speed, you press [code]<n>m[/code]. The number given to it will become the scroll speed in beats. If you want to set the scroll speed to 1 beat, you can press [code]m[/code]

To change the grid size, you press [code]<n>n[/code]. The number given to it will become the distance between grid lines in beats.

If you want to set the grid size to be the same as the scroll speed, you can press [code]N[/code]. If you want to align yourself to the grid, you can press [code]n[/code].
