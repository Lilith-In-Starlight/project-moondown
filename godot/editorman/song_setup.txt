[b]Setting up a song's data[/b]

A song has data like bpm and title. You set this data using the command line. To enter the command line, enter the [code]:[/code] keybind. We'll use the [code]:set[/code] command in this lesson.

To set a song's bpm, simply enter the [code]:set bpm=<d>[/code] command. For example, [code]:set bpm=50[/code] will set the bpm to 50.

To set a song's title, simply enter the [code:set title=<s>[/code] command. For example, [code]:set title=Pandora's Tower[/code] will set the title to [b]Pandora's Tower[/b].

To set a song's author, simply enter the [code]:set author=<s>[/code] command. For example, [code]:set title=Pandora's Tower[/code] will set the title to [b]Pandora's Tower[/b].

If you'd rather, you can also set the length of each beat in seconds. This is called the "crotchet." [code]:set crotchet=<d>[/code]
